# Kotlin DSL for Building and Manipulating Complex Data Structures

This project provides a Kotlin DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that allows developers to easily build and manipulate complex data structures in a concise and expressive way. The DSL offers a fluent and intuitive syntax for creating nested data structures, such as trees, graphs, or custom hierarchical structures.

## Key Features

1. **DSL syntax for defining data structures:**
   - Uses Kotlin's builder pattern and lambda expressions to create a readable and expressive syntax for defining complex data structures.
   - Allows nesting of data structures and provides a clean way to specify relationships between elements.

2. **Traversal and manipulation functions:**
   - Implements extension functions for common traversal operations, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
   - Provides built-in functions for manipulating data structures, such as adding/removing elements, updating values, and transforming the structure.

3. **Functional programming concepts:**
   - Utilizes Kotlin's functional programming features, such as higher-order functions, lambdas, and immutability.
   - Implements common functional operations like map, filter, and reduce on the data structures.

4. **Generic type support:**
   - Makes the DSL generic, allowing it to work with different data types.
   - Ensures type safety and provides compile-time checks for type compatibility.

5. **Concise and expressive usage:**
   - Demonstrates the usage of the DSL through examples that showcase its conciseness and expressiveness compared to traditional Kotlin code.
   - Includes complex scenarios that highlight the benefits of using the DSL for building and manipulating data structures.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Kotlin DSL for building and manipulating data structures:

```kotlin
val dataStructure = buildDataStructure("A") {
    addChild(Node("B") {
        addChild(Node("D"))
        addChild(Node("E"))
    })
    addChild(Node("C") {
        addChild(Node("F"))
        addChild(Node("G"))
    })
}

println("Depth-First Search:")
dataStructure.dfs { node ->
    println(node.value)
}

println("\nBreadth-First Search:")
dataStructure.bfs { node ->
    println(node.value)
}

val transformedStructure = dataStructure.map { it.toLowerCase() }
println("\nTransformed Structure:")
transformedStructure.dfs { node ->
    println(node.value)
}

val filteredStructure = dataStructure.filter { it != "B" }
println("\nFiltered Structure:")
filteredStructure?.dfs { node ->
    println(node.value)
}
```

In this example, we create a sample data structure using the DSL. We demonstrate the usage of `dfs` and `bfs` traversal functions, as well as `map` and `filter` operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Kotlin DSL for building and manipulating complex data structures, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
